# Viterbi_decoder

1. Information theory project

This project 'Viterbi Decoding' is coded on Python language. There are two files under folder code:viterbi.py and main.py

viterbi.py : implement the encoding and decoding algorithm along with error and hamming distance calculating function

main.py : generates the input bit sequence, call encoding decoding functio and plot the graph for BER vs error in decoding.  

Executing the code:
- Code can be run in command window
- Set the current directory to the file where code is saved
- to execute the code write: 
	python main.py
